Tuxocide

3D FPS a war rages on in antarctica...

tuxes are being skinned for their pelt by an invasive alien species

tux throws snowballs that just slow down the aliens temporarily

alien throws orb (plasma proximity bomb) that has a large invisible radius that when collides
with a tux(s) it expands to its invisible radius like an explosion converting all colliding
tux(s) to pelts, an alien then has to collect the pelt and carry it back to their border
until a ufo collects it from them. (collides with all objects, aliens can accidentally kill each other)

it's up to you to stop the aliens, when you shoot one they flatten and widen animation using scale.

when you kill one they scale inwards to a rod shape, then elongate upwards, the bottom then compresses to the top
and they then vanish, like a sci-fi teleportation animation.

your gun (AK-47) shoots actual projectiles with velocity

aliens take three shots to die ~?

aliens materialise from the bottom of the ufo beam (opacity in)

tux appear from wells, the iceholes (opacity in) and then tux moves up into the game from under it.

the ufo drops on one half (~the hilly?) and tuxs appear on the other half (the flat)
have a small no mans land zone inbetween

tree's are scattered at random using a fixed seed unless a game reset is triggered then random seed

when tux dead pelt will rotate on the spot of death, can only be collected by aliens

Aliens and Tux just spawn non-stop, maybe have the rate progress faster and faster over time
score how many tux skinned vs how many aliens killed
? maybe have a alien / own pelt collected stat, and allow player to collect pelts

gun firing recoil animation (distance from camera)

you can kill tux if you want (one hit kill)
you are the only tux with a gun, you are rambo tux

shooting pelt makes it spin faster briefly
shooting floor makes splash
shooting tree destroys bullet
shooting snowball destroys snowball
shooting plasma bomb does nothing (destroy bullet)

aliens have to take pelts back to the ufo, in which the pelt will opacity out under the ufo beam as it dematerialises.

the single ufo is quite busy having to collect pelts and place new aliens on its side of the map
